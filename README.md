# cyberzoo
The original Cyberzoo, recreated from its old home of http://www.motivesoft.demon.co.uk/cyberzoo/, which now exists only in archive form.

The Cyberzoo site was first created in 1997 or thereabouts as a tribute and support page for all things related to virtual pets, initially Tamagotchis and Nano Babies, and as a sister site to the Internet newsgroup, alt.toys.virtual-pets.

The site is recreated, unaltered, here for posterity. It is still very much a 1997 website and should be enjoyed just for that reason.
