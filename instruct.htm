<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">Now that you have your
Tamagotchi, you must do these three things:</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">1. Wake up Tamagotchi from
its sleep by removing the insulating sheet (pull paper tab from
side of body).</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">2. Set the Tamagotchi
communications screen (reset operation). Press the reset switch
on the rear of the egg with a pointed object. <em>Note:Remember
not to press the reset switch too hard when using a sharp rod,
pencils, sharp pens, etc.</em></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">3. Adjust the time
difference between Tamagotchi's planet and Earth (timer set).
First press the middle button (B) to bring up the timer screen.
Use the left button (A) to set the hours and the (B) button to
set the minutes. Once you have set the correct time, press the
right button (C) to start the timer. Next, return to the main
screen by pressing the (B) button again.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">When you have completed
these three steps, a pulsating egg will appear. Tamagotchi will
hatch in about 5 minutes. <em>Note: During this time only the
timer and reset functions are available.</em></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">As soon as Tamagotchi
hatches, it will beep at you for attention. This is where the
health meter comes in handy. In order to start Tamagotchi on a
good growth path, it will need to be fed and played with soon
after it hatches.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">FUNCTIONS</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">Feed: Press (A) until
knife and fork icon is highlighted, then press (B). Select either
Meal or Snack by pressing (A) to move the arrow, then press (B)
to feed Tamagotchi. Do not overfeed it, otherwise it will refuse
to eat.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">Light: Press (A) until the
light bulb icon is highlighted, then press (B). Select either
'On' or 'Off' by pressing (A) to move the arrow, then press (B).
Turn the light off when it is sleeping! Tamagotchi will turn the
light on when it wakes up.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">Duck: Tamagotchi goes to
the toilet. If droppings appear on the screen, they must be
cleaned up or Tamagotchi will become ill. Press (A) until the
Duck icon is highlighted, then press (B) to flush the screen.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">Health Meter: Check
Tamagotchi's health by pressing (A) until the Health Meter icon
is highlighted, then press (B) to check Tamagotchi's age/weight,
discipline, hunger and happiness. After you have checked, press
(C) to return to the main screen. You should also check this
screen if Tamagotchi beeps at you and the 'attention' icon is
highlighted.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">Play: Press (A) until the
bat and ball icon is highlighted, then press (B) to begin the
game. The object is to guess which way Tamagotchi will turn. To
choose left, press (A), to choose right, press (B). If you choose
the correct direction, Tamagotchi will be happy. There are 5
chances in each game to match Tamagotchi; the more you match, the
happier Tamagotchi will be. To stop the game press (C). After
playing, check the happiness meter.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">Medicine: If a skull image
appears, Tamagotchi is ill and needs medicine. Press (A) until
the medicine icon is highlighted, then press (B). Sometimes 2 or
3 injections are needed before Tamagotchi is well.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">Attention: When this icon
is highlighted, Tamagotchi needs something. check the Health
Meter, to determine what Tamagotchi needs. If Tamagotchi doesn't
need anything, it must be disciplined or the Attention icon will
stay highlighted.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">Discipline: Tamagotchi
needs discipline if it:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">beeps even though it
        is full and happy</font></li>
    <li><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">won't eat when it is
        hungry</font></li>
    <li><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">won't play games when
        it is not very happy. If you neglect to discipline
        Tamagotchi when needed, it might grow up into an
        unattractive, bad mannered alien.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">HAPPINESS AND HUNGER</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">There are 4 hearts on the
Happy and Hunger screens. The more hearts that are filled, the
better satisfied it is. You must feed or play with Tamagotchi in
order to fill the empty hearts. If you keep it full and happy, it
will grown into a cute, happy cybercreature. If you neglect
Tamagotchi, it will grown into an unattractive alien.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">DISCIPLINE STATUS CHECK</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">As the meter moves towards
the right, it indicated you are raising a well-behaved
Tamagotchi.</font></p>

units.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">Age: 1 yr = 1 year</font></p>

    <li><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">One Earth day is

        change appearance several times before it reaches its
        adult form.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">Each time you hatch a
        new Tamagotchi it could grow up to be any one of several
        adult forms.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">Tamagotchi will
        always return to its home planet. How well you care for
        it will determine how long Tamagotchi stays on Earth.
        When it is time for Tamagotchi to return to its home
        planet, there is nothing you can do. But, don't worry,
        you can always hatch another egg.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4" face="MS Sans Serif">In order to hatch
        another Tamagotchi, press (A) and (C) simultaneously and
        a new pulsating egg will appear. In about 5 minutes a new
        Tamagotchi will be born. Maybe you will raise a different
        version of Tamagotchi this time. Try it and see.</font></li>
