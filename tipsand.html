<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><em>What
time does my Nano pal go to sleep?</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">It seems
that Nano pals like to go to bed at 9.09 pm, sometimes a couple
of minutes earlier than this.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><em>What
time do they wake up in the morning?</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Er... they
wake up before I do! But it would seem that they wake up just
after 7, probably at about 7.09am.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><em>Which
is food and which is a snack?</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">This can
be a bit confusing, but the rule is that the food is the item on
the left, and the snack is the one on the right.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><em>Can I
pause the game?</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, go
into Time Mode and press the square button. While holding it
down, press the left arrow button until the time starts to flash.
You can either leave it like that until you are ready to reset
the time and get the game going again, or you can set the time to
about 9.10pm and your Nano will go to sleep for hours. You can
then reset the time correctly when you are ready for it to wake
up.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><em>How
old do they live to?</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">The oldest
I have ever got my Nano Kitty was 36, though I have had reports
from people who have got their Nano Kittys and Puppys to live to
be much older than this. Well done to these people, who obviously
look after their pets extremely well indeed!</font></p>

        face="Comic Sans MS">It can be hard to tell this at
        first, but you soon get the hang of it. The best way is
        to go to the screen with your Baby's name on it, and look
        at the face in the corner. There is a different face for
        a boy and for a girl.</font></td>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">If you
wish to wake up your pal in the night, then discipline it while
it is asleep. It will wake up for a while, for you to give it
food, or for whatever it was you forgot to do earlier when it was
awake.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">When
playing games with your Nano pal, don't worry too much if you
don't win the game. Your pal will still be happy that you played
with it, and some of the happy hearts will fill anyway. </font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">You only
need to fill up one discipline heart. If you then ensure that
your pal is well fed and happy, the rest of the hearts will fill
up on their own.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">When your
pal beeps at you and the attention icon is showing, try the
following:-</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">1) Check
the health icon, your pal may need food, games or discipline.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">2)Try
giving a bath, your pal may want cleaning.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">3) Give a
snack - too many aren't good for your pal, but the occasional
little treat will do no harm.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">4) It is
possible that your pal needs a booster shot - did you give it
medicine 2 or more hours ago? If so, then you need to give a
second shot to ensure good health.</font></p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"
        face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes, the attention icon will
        remain on the screen from the time the first dose of
        medicine was given, until the booster shot has been
        given. So as long as you have checked that your pal needs
        nothing else, don't worry as the icon will disappear
        after you have administered the booster shot.</font></td>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">As your
pet gets older, it gets slower (don't we all!) so you may find it
is much harder to catch the ball or mouse when playing the
chasing game. If this happens, don't worry too much - even if you
don't catch the ball or mouse, your pet will still be happy that
you played with it, and it's happy score will still go up, just
not as much as if you'd won the game.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Oh
no, I've got my Nano wet!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">If this
happens, don't panic! Remove the back and take out the batteries.
If you have a hairdryer with a cool setting, then you could help
it dry out a little with it. Then just leave it to dry for a few
days. When it is properly dry, re-insert the batteries and
replace the cover, and your Nano should be just fine. If you are
very unlucky and get something other than water on it, like sweet
coffee, then you may have to be very brave and do as above, but
dip it in water first to rinse off anything potentially sticky. I
can't promise that this will work though. But always worth a try!</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><em>Changing
the time</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">Go into
time mode by pressing the circle button. Then press the square
button. While holding it down, press one of the arrow buttons
until the time starts to flash. Change the time using the left
and right arrow buttons, then press the square button again to
start the clock. Press the circle button to return to the game
mode.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFF00" size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><em><strong><u>Myths</u></strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><em>&quot;Nano
pals will wake you up during the night.&quot;</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">This is
false - your Nano pal will go to sleep at 9.09pm. If it went to
sleep in need of medicine, it may wake up soon after for it's
booster shot, but it will go back to sleep very soon afterwards.
The only reason they would wake up in the night is if the clock
had been set incorrectly.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><em>&quot;When
your Nano pal dies, you have to buy a new one.&quot;</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">This is
definitely false! I don't know of any virtual pet that this
applies to. They have either reset buttons, or reset facilities,
so you just start a new pet or pal.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><em>&quot;Nano
pals don't change as they get older.&quot;</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">They
certainly do! The Kitty grows up into a tiger-like pet, the Puppy
into a big dog, and it's very exciting when your Nano Baby cuts
it's first teeth and learns to walk!</font></p>
